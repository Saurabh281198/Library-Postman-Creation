# Library-Postman-Creation
In this project, a lightweight automation framework has been built to write API Automation test cases fast and assert them easily. The API provides a set of endpoints that can be accessed using HTTP requests. These endpoints follow RESTful principles, allowing you to interact with the book data in a structured and intuitive way.
