# Library-Postman-Creation

### Introduction 😇

👨‍💻 In this project, a lightweight automation framework has been built to write API Automation test cases fast and assert them easily. 

👨‍💻 The API provides a set of endpoints that can be accessed using HTTP requests. These endpoints follow RESTful principles, allowing you to interact with the book data in a structured and intuitive way.

👨‍💻 To test the functionality of the API, I have used Postman, a popular tool for API testing. Postman provides a user-friendly interface for sending  requests and receiving responses, making it easier to validate the behavior of the API.

👨‍💻 Using Postman, we can send requests to the appropriate endpoints to perform specific operations on the book data. 

👨‍💻 For example, we can use the POST method to create a new book record by providing the necessary details in the request body. The API will process the request and return a response containing the newly created book's information.

👨‍💻 Similarly, you can use the GET method to retrieve book records from the API. You can send a GET request to the appropriate endpoint, and the API will return a response containing the requested book data.

👨‍💻 Deleting book records can be done using the DELETE methods. By sending a DELETE request to the API will remove the specified book from the database.

### Directory & File structure 🕸️🕸️

In this project, it has one directory that contain all the postman files in the form of `.json` as described below. 

├── Library Postman Files 

|    ├── Library.postman_collection.json           → Collection file where all the requests are available 

|    ├── QA Environment.postman_environment.json   → Environment file where QA environment base url is added 

|    ├── UAT Environment.postman_environment.json  → Environment file where UAT environment base url is added 

|    ├── workspace.postman_globals.json            → Global file where some variables are defined at global level

|    ├── BookDetails.csv                           → Test data file in which multiple book details have been added

|    ├── Reports                                   → Reports generated by newman have been added in this folder
 
|    └── Screenshots                               → Screenshots have been added in the folder for the tests executed
 
### Framework 🎗️🎗️

- This Framework is able to test all the request together by uploading the excel data.

- All the assertions has been asserted and tested.

- Framework is built dynamically to perform all the actions in one go.
  
- It has been made sure that every line of code is clean, well-commented, and self-explanatory. Code is scalable & maintainable in the long run.

## Execution Steps 🎢🎢

🥇 First way of execution is by importing all the .json files in postman and running the collection file with the help of runner by uploading the excel data file as input data. Below is the screenshot for test results:-

🥈 Second way of execution can be done by using Newman. Before that setup the newman in your local system and once setup is done, open the command line and navigate to the directory where files have been saved.

** One way of execution can be achieved by newman without report generation. Enter the below code:-

[ newman run Library.postman_collection.json -d BookDetails.csv -e QAEnvironment.postman_environment.json -g workspace.postman_globals ]

** Other way of excecution can be achieved by newman with report generation. Enter the below code:-

[ newman run Library.postman_collection.json -d BookDetails.csv -e QAEnvironment.postman_environment.json -g workspace.postman_globals -r htmlextra]
